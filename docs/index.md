## Research Interests 

My research centers on "air-sea interactions" and "climate prediction". In the area of the "air-sea interactions", I focus on: 1) formation and maintenance mechanims of the western North Pacific anomalous anticyclone (WNPAC); 2) formation and growth mechanisms of Indian Ocean dipole (IOD); 3) mechanisms for ENSO-driven precipation anomalies and their changes under the global warming; 4) formation mechanisms of tropical Pacific decadal variability; 5) the global climate impacts of the Atlantic multi-decadal variability (AMV). In the area of the "climate prediction", I focus on the development of coupled assimilation scheme for model initialization and the development of prediction system based on coupled general circulation model.
